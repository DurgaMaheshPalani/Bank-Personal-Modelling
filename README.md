*In this,we are performing several algorithms to find the best result among the all algorithms.

*Firstly we need to do the Exploratory Data Analysis,

*after that we need to find out the target attribute because we need to build a model that will help them to identify the patterns

*then we have to do data pre-processing with the help of One-hot encoder and Standard Scaler,

*the Algorithms performed in this data are: 1)Linear Regression,2)Logistic Regression,3)Decision Tree,4)Random Forest.

*Then we have to findout the best classifier among all classifiers.
